					Log Structured File System

What is it ?
--------------

We have implemented log structured file system at user level using FUSE (File system at User space). A Log Structured Filesystem is a technique for disk storage management in which all the file writes are written sequentially in a log-like structure.  A log consists of a series of segments where each segment contains both data and inode blocks. A log structured file system gathers a segment worth of data in memory and appends the segment at the end of the log. This improves the write performance while maintaining the same read performance.

Documentation

The detailed description of the project is provided in the file project_doc.txt


Implementation:
--------------------

Installation of FUSE:
--------------------------
Before the compiling and running LFS, installation of FUSE is necessary. The FUSE version 26 has been used for our project. FUSE can be downloaded from the below link : 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/fuse/files/fuse-2.X/

Download fuse-2.8.6.tar.gz (505.3 kB) [ the latest version]

Uncompress the fuse-2.8.6.tar.gz using the command 
> tar -xvf fuse-2.8.6.tar.gz
 
FUSE installation :
> ./configure
>  make
>  make install

Compiling LFS:
-------------------------------------
The LFS filesystem is compiled by going into the src subdirectory and executing the command

$ make

Mounting the LFS :
----------------------
The LFS is mounted by running the command lfs from the src directory which takes the mountdir as the argument.

$ mkdir /tmp/fuse
$ ./lfs /tmp/fuse
	
	here /tmp/fuse represents the mountdir. The lfs command also creates file lfslog, a huge file that represents our filesystem . This file is created in the current directory, src directory.

To unmount the filesystem , we need to execute the fusermount command with -u option.

$ fusermount -u /tmp/fuse

Running Testcases:
-----------------------
Once the filesystem is mounted using lfs command, the testcases can be run by executing the test_lfs command in src directory.

$ gcc test_lfs.c -o test_lfs
$ ./test_lfs
	The output of the testcase execution are displayed on the screen.

To rerun LFS:
------------------

- Unmount LFS, remove logfile, remove mountdir, create mountdir again.

$ fusermount -u /tmp/fuse ;  rm -f ./lfslog ; \rm -rf /tmp/fuse ; mkdir /tmp/fuse

$ ./lfs /tmp/fuse


The description and testing of LFS and how to run the test cases, is specified in project_doc.txt.
